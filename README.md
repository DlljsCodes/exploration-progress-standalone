# Exploration Progress Standalone

Exploration Progress is a tool that allows [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) explorer players to see their progress from one star system to another as a percentage.

This is the original proof of concept standalone program, which has since been depreciated in favour of a plugin for [ED Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector). Unlike the plugin, it unfortunately does not save your origin and destination systems and cannot automatically get your current system from the game. It also does not auto update, so you'll need to run the program and reenter information every time you want to get an update on your progress. As a result, it is stronly recommended you use the plugin instead.

### Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7
* Internet connection (to connect to [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/))

### How to Use
1. Download [the code](https://github.com/DlljsCodes/exploration-progress-standalone/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract the file
1. Run standalone.py
1. Enter the system you started at (Origin System)
1. Enter the system you are heading towards (Destination System)
1. Enter the system your current system (Current System)
1. Your progress towards the destination system will be displayed as a percentage
